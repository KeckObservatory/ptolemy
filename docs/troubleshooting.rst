B. **My queues are gone after I updated the server.**

The queues are stored in memory by the process running the main Flask Server. Once its killed the memory is lost.

C. **I log into the system and I am rerouted to the login page**

Sometimes the authentication server reroutes the user back to the login page.
Deleting the cookies and cache from the browser should fix the issue.
